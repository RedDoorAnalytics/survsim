TITLE: `SURVSIM' : module to simulate complex survival data.

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR: survsim simulates survival times from parametric distributions. Distributions include the exponential, Gompertz and Weibull. Newton-Raphson 
iterations are used to generate survival times under a 2-component mixture model or cause-specific hazards model for competing risks. Non-proportional hazards 
can be included with all models except a mixture model; under an exponential or Weibull model covariates are interacted with log time, under a Gompertz 
model covariates are interacted with time. Baseline covariates can be included in all models.
