TITLE: `SURVSIM' : module to simulate survival times from a variety of Weibull based
distributions.

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR: survsim simulates survival times from a variety of Weibull based 
distributions. Survival times can be generated from a standard Weibull distribution, 
a 2-component mixture Weibull distribution, and Weibull based cause-specific hazards 
for competing risks. Baseline covariates can be included.
