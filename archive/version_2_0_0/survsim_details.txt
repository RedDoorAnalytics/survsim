TITLE: `SURVSIM' : module to simulate complex survival data.

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR: survsim simulates survival times from parametric distributions and user-defined hazard functions. Standard distributions available 
include the exponential, Gompertz and Weibull. Alternatively, a user defined [log] [cumulative] hazard function can be specified, in Mata code using 
colon operators, with survival times generated using a combination of Gaussian quadrature and root finding techniques. Finally, survival times can be 
generated under cause-specific hazard models for competing risks, using standard parametric distributions. Baseline covariates and complex time-dependent 
effects can also be specified.
