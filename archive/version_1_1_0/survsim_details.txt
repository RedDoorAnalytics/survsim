TITLE: `SURVSIM' : module to simulate survival times from a variety of Weibull based
distributions.

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR: survsim simulates survival times from Weibull or Gompertz parametric distributions. 
Survival times can be generated from a single parametric distribution, a 2-component mixture model, and 
from the all-cause distribution of cause-specific hazards for competing risks. Baseline covariates can 
be included in all models. Non-proportional hazards can be included with all models except a mixture model; 
under a Weibull model covariates are interacted with log time, under a Gompertz model covariates are 
interacted with time.
